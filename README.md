# Asanify

Asanify is a website that allows users to upload a video of their yoga practice and returns the sequence of poses and a high-level summary of the focus and benefits of the sequence.  Asanify uses computer vision to classify poses from video frames and uses a sliding window average approach to reduce error. I built this data product as an Insight Data Science Fellow.
